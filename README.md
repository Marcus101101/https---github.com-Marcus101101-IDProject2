We did not use Github to share, instead we send multiple copies to each other
to keep track of our progress.
If we use Github to share, we would encounter multiple problems where we could not upload the file.

# QuizLab

The Website we are creating is called QuizLab. The main aim of QuizLab is to allow people
to do quizzes to reinforce on their knowledge on different subjects.

Each category consist of two different level of difficulty, Basic and Advance.
There is also a leaderboard to display other people's score where users can choose to submit
their score after completing the quiz to try to get the top of the leaderboard.
 
## Design Process

Overall:
The website is designed to with the target of this website is student who wants to reinforce on things they have learnt before. We started off with a quick description of the website to tell the user of the main goal of the webstie. Further down we have a quick show on how many different subject are available for the users to do.

Background(Marcus):
We choose light gray to be the background as it represents reflective.
This allows the user to reflect on what they have learnt in the past and reinforce on the knowledge by doing the quiz. We also added a feature to allow the user to change the theme of the website to black so that the user will have a better experience when they are using the website in the dark.

Icon(Design: Marcus:
After scrolling down the home page, we will see multiple icons to indicate each quiz available.
Upon hovering over each quiz there would be a which animation where it enlarge the icon size
and it would show an animation where it describe what the quiz is about. We added shadow to the icons so we can give the icon to have a 3D feel, making it look more realistic and it also looks better our opinion.

Quiz page(Marucs):
The quiz page is made with the intention of giving users a easy look on the quiz. The color of the quiz page varies with the different subjects. There is also a descrription on the center top of the quiz to show the user the category of the quiz. The quiz box is made flexible where if the question is long, it will enlarge automatically.

Comment(Marcus):
The comment section is for users to see past comment from users had experience with using the website before. This allows new users to have a sense for reassurance on what they can expect and be more encouraged to use the website.

LeaderBoard(Ri Sheng):
The leaderboard page is made with the intention of showing the user all the submitted score after doing the quiz. Each table is labelled with the category name at the top and the color code of the quiz along with it. The score is displayed with a different colour each rank to secition out each table for the user to have a better time looking at the leaderboard. The colorr of the table also matches with the color code of the quiz so that the user can also find the leaderboard of the table via colours.

Lottie(Marcus):
The Lottie is to do an animation beside the about section to show that this is a website about a quiz. The Lottie is a pencil writing on a paper further telling the users that this is a quiz website.


## Features
 
 Navigation bar(Marcus):
 The naviation bar is at the top of the webpage where when it is flipped from landscape mode to potrait mode, it would turn into a extendable navigation bar on click. It leads to the main part of the website, Home page, About, Quiz page and Leaderboard.

 Icons(Marcus):
 Each icon is made with animations where on hover, it will enlarge with a gradient to act as a shadow with the text animated smoothly into place for the user to view. The description consist of the title of the quiz and the rough description of the quiz. The shadow of the icon will also enlarge with the icon.

 Quiz(Marcus):
 The quiz consist of many functions where when you clicked the wrong option it will display it as a wrong answer and will not add a score to the total score. When the choice is correct, it will display a correct sign and add a score to the total score. After the quiz, the user will be prompted to input their user name if they want to submit their score to the leaderboard, it is optional and will not submit without the user consent.

 Leaderboard(Ri Sheng):
 The leaderboard is made with the help of a API. When a user submit their score, it will add the user's name and the score into the table, and it will be printed out into the leaderboard when it is opened again. It is made so that the leaderboard fills the website opened. When using on the phone, it will simply move down so that the user can scroll down to see the scores. There will be a maximun of 100 submission per category and it will be in descending order of the score.

 Comment(Marcus):
 The comment is made with the help of javascript where the star rating can show the recorded rating of the website.

Lottie(Marcus):
The lottie is used to tell users that they are doing the quiz. Its other purpose is to make the website looks nicer due to the moving animation simulating a person doing a quiz.

## Technologies Used
We used html to code the website and CSS to design. We also use Javascript for someof the animation and used RestDB API to store the data of the score for the leaderbaord. We also used openTDB for the quiz section where we got the quiz questions and stuff from.
